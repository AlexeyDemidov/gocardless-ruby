## GoCardless Ruby Client Library

The GoCardless Ruby client provides a simple Ruby interface to the GoCardless
API.

If you want to use the library as an individual merchant, refer to the
[merchant guide](https://gocardless.com/docs/ruby/merchant_client_guide). If
you want to support multiple merchant accounts, see the
[partner guide](https://gocardless.com/docs/ruby/partner_client_guide).

The full API reference is available at on
[rubydoc.info](http://rubydoc.info/github/gocardless/gocardless-ruby/master/frames).
